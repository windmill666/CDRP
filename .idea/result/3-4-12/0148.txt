Tried aggregator 2 times.
MIP Presolve eliminated 2555 rows and 1459 columns.
MIP Presolve modified 114 coefficients.
Aggregator did 23 substitutions.
Reduced MIP has 27 rows, 22 columns, and 76 nonzeros.
Reduced MIP has 22 binaries, 0 generals, 0 SOSs, and 0 indicators.
Presolve time = 0.00 sec. (2.71 ticks)
Found incumbent of value 2.000000 after 0.00 sec. (3.25 ticks)

Root node processing (before b&c):
  Real time             =    0.00 sec. (3.30 ticks)
Parallel b&c, 4 threads:
  Real time             =    0.00 sec. (0.00 ticks)
  Sync time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
  Wait time (average)   =    0.00 sec.
                          ------------
Total (root+branch&cut) =    0.00 sec. (3.30 ticks)
obj = 2.0
